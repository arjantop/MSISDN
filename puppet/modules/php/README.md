Introduction
============

Why Use puppet-php
------------------

* it's [very fast to install](http://puppet-php.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html), a few minutes tops.

* it supports [all PHP SAPIs](http://puppet-php.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sapi.html) out of the box.

* it supports [a lot of PHP extensions](http://puppet-php.readthedocs.org/en/latest/extensions.html) out of the box.

* it's is very flexible and has tons of configuration options, and sane defaults.

* it aims to stay out of your way, and if it happens to get in your way, you can change the undesired behavior very easily.

* it removes the boilerplate code from your manifests, which mean less code to maintain, and less code to spend time unit testing.

* it uses the MIT license.
